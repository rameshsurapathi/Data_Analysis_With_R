# Data_Analysis_With_R
This repository contains sample EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis using R and R studio). Exploratory data analysis focuses on exploring data to understand the dataâ€™s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, to consider how that data set came into existence, and to decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods.
